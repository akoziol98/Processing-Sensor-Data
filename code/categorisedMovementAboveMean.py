This function is going to convert to 1s and 0s the input time series so it
can be later used to estimate the delay between the manually coded data
and the sensor recordings.

Input: movementSeries -> the sensor measured data
Output: categorisedMovement -> the categorised version of the data

V1.0 Creation of the document by David Lopez Perez 05.10.2020
V1.1 The information about the moving average and the merging time is
asked to the user by David Lopez Perez 16.11.2020
V1.2 The information about the moving average and merging time is also
accepted by the function to asking for information many times when using
loops by David Lopez Perez 22.12.2020
V1.3 Now the function returns the moving average used in the function to
correct the time series later on by David Lopez Perez 20.07.2021
